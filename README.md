# Datamart Project
Repo for the final project in the datawarehouse design course.  
The scoring will be as follows:

- 2 pts - An explanation of your dataset  
- 3 pts - A list of points and / or questions that are being addressed with your data mart;  
- 5 pts - A diagram of your final mart (dimensions and fact(s)) - saved as .png or .svg from draw.io or similar tool;  
- 5 pts - SQL DDL (with markdown explanations) showing your table construction (in blocks in your .ipynb);  
- 10 pts - .sql file with your SQL DDL in the same folder as your .ipynb (must be runable);  
- 5 pts - SQL DML (with mardown explanations) showing your data loading from stage  
- 10 pts - .sql file with your SQL DML in the same folder as your .ipynb (must be runable);  

After looking at this read me file, I would do the following (you can put it all in the .ipynb if you choose)

You can access the ipynb [here](./Sample_Mart_Project_Template.ipynb).  

The mart will be constructed as follows:

[SQL DDL Template](./data/StarSchemaTemplate.sql)  

[SQL DML Loader](./data/DataLoader.sql)
